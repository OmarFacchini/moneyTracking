# moneyTracking

# to update 

this is an program that allows me to keep track of the money that I've spent and on what each month and save it on a file.

it allows to insert multiple lines of text, but it stops when given a blank.

## file format example:
```
### this is ok: 
line1 
line2 
line3 

this isn't possible since it will stop when inserted the blank line, the only way to make it happen is putting even a single space in the blank line:
line1 
line2 
line3 
 
line4
````
